# SnakeGame
🐍 Snake Game (Java Swing)  This project is a classic Snake Game developed using Java Swing and AWT, focused on implementing core game logic through event-driven programming and GUI development in Java.
The player controls the snake using keyboard arrow keys, guiding it to consume randomly generated food within a bounded play area. Each time the snake eats food, its length increases and the score is updated in real time, making the game progressively more challenging. The game ends when the snake collides with its own body, and players can restart the game using a single key press.

A Swing Timer is used to handle continuous movement and screen updates, ensuring smooth gameplay and consistent performance. The graphical interface is rendered using Java’s Graphics class, featuring a clean layout with a visible game boundary, score display, and clear visual feedback during gameplay and on game-over events.

The project demonstrates fundamental concepts such as keyboard event handling, timer-based animation, collision detection, and object-oriented design. It also showcases how Java Swing components can be effectively used to build interactive desktop applications.

This Snake Game is ideal for beginners looking to understand Java GUI programming or as a mini-project for academic submissions and portfolios.
